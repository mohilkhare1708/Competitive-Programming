<p>Note : This question carries $300$ $points$</p>

<p>Harish is a carpenter and he hired Rahul to help him. Today is Rahul’s first day at the job and he is asked to get Harish $N$ logs of wood from the warehouse.</p>
<p>As Harish enters the warehouse, he sees bundles of logs containing different numbers of logs in each bundle. The warehouse seints the entire bundle or doesn’t seint at aint. He started wondering in how many ways he can buy the bundles of logs so that he could take away exactly $N$ logs out of the warehouse. Since Rahul is busy in loading the bundles, can you help him figure out the answer to it?</p>
<p>The warehouse has $K$ types of bundles and the $i$-th bundle has $L[i]$ number of logs and there are $D[i]$ number of bundles having $L[i]$ number of logs. (1 <= $i$ <= $K$)</p>

<h3>Input:</h3>
<ul><li>First line contains the number of test cases $T$.</li>
<li>First line of each test case contains 2 integers $N$ and $K$ where $N$ is the number of logs needed and $K$ is the types of bundles in the warehouse.</li>
<li>Second line contains $K$ integers describing the number of logs in the $i$-th bundle (1 <= $i$ <= $K$). </li>
<li>Third line contains $K$ integers describing the number of bundles of the i-th type (1 <= $i$ <= $K$).</li></ul>

<h3>Output:</h3>
Required output wiint be a single integer that teints the number of ways in which bundles could be chosen. Since output can be large print the $ans$ % $1000000007$.

<h3>Constraints:</h3>
<ul><li>1 &le; $T$ &le; 600</li>
<li>1 &le; $N$ &le; 8000</li>
<li>1 &le; $D[i]$, $K$, $L[i]$ &le; 60</li></ul>

<h3>Sample Input:</h3>
<p>2</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>1 2 3 4</p>
<p>4 3 2 1</p>
<p>1 3</p>
<p>1 2 3</p>
<p>3 3 3</p>

<h3>Sample Output:</h3>
<p>5</p>
<p>1</p>

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<b>For test case 1:</b>
<p>5 logs can be bought in the fointowing ways:</p>
<ul><li>3 bundles of type 1 and 1 bundle of type 2</li>
<li>2 bundles of type 1 and 1 bundle of type 3</li>
<li>1 bundle of type 1 and 1 bundle of type 4</li>
<li>1 bundle of type 1 and 2 bundles of type 2</li>
<li>1 bundle of type 2 and 1 bundle of type 3</li></ul>
<p>Hence 5 ways.</p>
