# Competitive-Programming
Repository for the solutions to all the questions I solve on various CP platforms. You'll usually find me active on Codechef, Codeforces and CSES platforms and I am a regular participant in Google CodeJam and Kickstart.

**To find a solution to a problem**
- For CSES
  - The problems are labeled as the problem name in 'camel case'.
- For Codechef
  - The soltuions to a past unrated contest can be found in ```Codechef > Unrated > CONTEST_CODE > PROBLEM_CODE```
  - The solutions to a rated contest can be found in ```Codechef > monthContestTypeYear > PROBLEM_CODE```
  - Solutions to practice problems can be found in ```Codechef > PROBLEM_CODE```
- For Codeforces
  - For all solutions, ```Codeforces > PROBLEM_CODE```
